@rubyireland check out a [blog post by TP from Logentries on digging into Engine Yard logs](https://logentries.com/blog/2012/02/digging-into-engineyard-logs/). It gives some insight into the different logs that may be of interest for your rails apps... oh yeah and what exactly you can do with them to fix your problems & improve your systems :-)

Feel free to post your thoughts on anything important we've omitted, or anything else you think is of interest to the ruby loggers out there...
