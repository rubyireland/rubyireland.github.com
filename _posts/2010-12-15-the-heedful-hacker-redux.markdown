I'm delighted that [Security Ninja David Rook](http://www.securityninja.co.uk/blog) will be giving a talk at the next Ruby Ireland meetup, he had to postpone his talk in November but was dying to come back to give his talk. So he'll be back in Jan 2011 As usual it's on in the trinity capital hotel at 7pm on Nov. 11th avec food & beer.

Hope to see you all there.
