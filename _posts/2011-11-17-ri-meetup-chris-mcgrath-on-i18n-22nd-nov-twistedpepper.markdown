The countries of Europe might be squabbling over their respective grievances with each other at the moment. But at Ruby Ireland we're looking to get on with our neighbours and give them a super fantastic user experience, as Chris McGrath talks internationalization.

It all goes down at the Twisted Pepper, which is located at 54 Middle Abbey Street, Dublin 1. Things as usual kick off at 7pm.

Don't be a stranger, head down to the locale (groan!) and meet the Ruby community on Nov 22nd and find out how easy it to make your site across borders!
