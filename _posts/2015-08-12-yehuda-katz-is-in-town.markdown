[Yehuda Katz](http://www.twitter.com/wycats) needs very little introduction.
For almost as long as I’ve
been writing Ruby and JavaScript, I’ve benefitted from Yehuda’s great
work. He’s a retired [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) and
[jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/) Core Team member, and a
current member of the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) Core Team. He is also
one of the creators of
[Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com/), an opinionated framework
for building ambitious applications,
which we rely on and enjoy tremendously at Intercom. His 9-to-5 home is
at the startup he founded, [Tilde Inc.](http://www.tilde.io/). There he works
on [Skylight](http://www.skylight.io/), the
smart profiler for Rails, and does [Ember.js
consulting](http://www.tilde.io/ember-consulting/). One of my
personal favorite projects he created is [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) - I’ve
deliberately forgotten ruby life before it ;)


Yehuda is a truly great open source innovator. It’s amazing and
inspiring to think of the number of people who’ve directly benefitted
using the tools/libraries he’s created or contributed to. So I’m really
happy that he’ll be joining us in Dublin next month, and speaking at our
[next big event at Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/events/on-product)
on 9th September at 6pm.

Tickets are €10, with all proceeds going to
[CoderDojo](https://www.coderdojo.com). The final batch
of tickets will be [released soon](https://www.intercom.io/events/on-product),
please join the waiting list to be kept informed when that happens.

As well as Yehuda, the [impressive Jules
Coleman](http://www.independent.ie/business/small-business/your-stories/hasslecom-the-highflier-who-left-office-job-for-online-cleaning-firm-30777217.html)
will tell
her story of building [hassle.com](https://hassle.com/), including teaching
herself Ruby/Rails
in the evenings while working for PWC. And there will be a range of talks
from our own speakers, lifting the lid on how we work across some
diverse and interesting topics.

I feel so tremendously lucky to be part of the thriving community that
is emerging in Ireland, I think back to the
[first time I got involved in
Ruby Ireland](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby_ireland/JSIyXQRVL_Q)
, with fondness, but also acknowledge how far we’ve come,
from scrambling to get 5 people to have pints and talk about Ruby, to
having hundreds of people turn up to tell stories and have chats about
the craft we are all so passionate about.

Hope to see you there!  
Darragh
