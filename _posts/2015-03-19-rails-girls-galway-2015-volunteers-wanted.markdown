Ever felt the stereotypes and prejudices that keep more women from
entering IT a little overwhelming? Want to contribute to change this
trend?

<img src="images/rg-galway.png" class="img-rounded postImageFloatRight" alt="Rails Girls Image" />

You can volunteer to co-organise and/or coach during a 2-day workshop
that will allow women to easily build a web application, demystifying
the "coding" activity.

The [workshop](http://railsgirls.com/galway) will be on June the 27th and 28th (Saturday and Sunday) from 9am to
5.30pm. It has been running since 2013 and is part of the [Rails
Girls](http://railsgirls.com) movement, successful worldwide.

If you are interested in coaching, we'd love to hear from you. And if you would
like to help organising, you can pick up a task from the long list
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2kssy6o9c2xsea/co-organisers_tasks.pdf).

In both cases, just let us know your intentions at
[railsgirlsgalway_at_gmail.com](railsgirlsgalway_at_gmail.com).


Thanks a million!

Myriam
