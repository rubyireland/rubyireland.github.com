When: Sat 30th June 2012, 11:00 to 17:00
Where: Engine Yard's Dublin office, on the top floor of 35 Barrow St, Dublin 4
Street view: [http://goo.gl/maps/NYuG](http://goo.gl/maps/NYuG)

So every once in a while you've gotta mix it up and see what's going on with other cool technologies, groups and geeks. That's the idea behind Frazzle - a loosely organised meeting of minds with an unconference style.

More about "unconferences": [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)

The day will kick off at 11:00 and run until 17:00 with people from various groups attending, demoing and speaking - such as Ruby Ireland, Python Ireland, Alt.Net, dublinjs and others.

The schedule is still being put together. The current draft is available at [http://piratepad.net/rAXQUB2Zd4](http://piratepad.net/rAXQUB2Zd4) If you are interested in attending please signup at that link too under the 'Who is coming?' section or, if you prefer, you can sign up through EventBrite [frazzle on eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3821773026/es2?srnk=1) Also, if you'd like to give a talk add your name and idea to the list of talks.

Thanks to Engine Yard for hosting us!
