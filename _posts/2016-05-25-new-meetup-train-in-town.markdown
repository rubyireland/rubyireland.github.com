This is a guest post by Jules Roman Polidario, organiser of the new
[Dublin Learning Ruby on Rails
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Learning-Ruby-on-Rails-Meetup).

Learning Ruby-on-Rails as a beginner is quite a challenging task,
especially if you are learning it by yourself, as I did in 2 years past.
Amidst a plethora of Rails tutorials in the Internet, there is still a
big difference if you are learning it together with your peers, and if
you have a mentor - who can hopefully answer immediately your
difficulties.

It may be potentially inefficient, as you cannot learn at
your own pace, rather than learning Rails with a book or from the web,
but being with others, solving with others, and immediately being able
to ask questions to the mentors, are I believe much more worthwhile
learning experiences.

With all that has been said, this is the main reason the meetup group
has been founded. We salute everyone who boarded the train for their
curiosity and interest. And also our venue sponsor - Dogpatch Labs. We
thank you all! Expect more meetup events in months to come! :)

> Tickets were free. This first trip has been expected to be a fun,
> casual, and a worthwhile experience; and surely seemed to have been so
> from everyone's smiles and appreciation :)
