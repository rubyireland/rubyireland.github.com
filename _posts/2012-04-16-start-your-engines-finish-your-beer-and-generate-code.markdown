This month we do have a treat for you. The irrepressible [Dr Nic](http://drnicwilliams.com/) (@drnic) is going to be talking at Ruby Ireland via Skype linkup on the subject of Code Generators!

Engine Yard, thanks to courtesy of Eamon Leonard and his crew, are supplying the venue... the speaker... and the beer... at their superbly kitted out [HQ on Barrow St](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35+Barrow+St.+Dublin+4,+ireland&hl=en&ll=53.340893,-6.237273&spn=0.015092,0.034847&sll=37.780991,-122.39559&sspn=0.004994,0.008712&vpsrc=6&hnear=35+Barrow+St,+Dublin+4,+Ireland&t=h&z=15), for what promises to be a turbo-charged event.

So what's all this about Code Generators you may ask? Well, Dr Nic's interest in this has recently been piqued when looking into some of the magic behind [railswizard.org](http://railswizard.org). Make it down to Barrow St on Thursday April 19th (it's sooner than you think!), lay back on the treatment table and let Dr Nic explain what it's all about from 7pm on. All are welcome, Ruby fanatics, Ruby-less heathens and interested techies at large. Your plans for Thursday evening just got better!
