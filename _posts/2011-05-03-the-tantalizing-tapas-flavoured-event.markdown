Are you interested in MongoDB, Rack and Sinatra? And some Web APIs and tapas for good measure?

Well then you'll be super-excited to hear that on Tuesday May 10th, Oisin Hurley will be giving a talk on "Constructing Web APIs with Rack, Sinatra and MongoDB". And yes there will be some tasty free tapas thrown into the bargain too! The speaker, [Oisin Hurley](http://twitter.com/oisin), is a Rubyist and veteran of the Irish software sector. So digest what he's got to say as we feed you at the Seagrass restaurant on South Richmond Street ( [directions](http://useamap.com/seagrass) ).

**Just in case you read that last paragraph too quickly - watch out that the event has changed from last month's venue!**

If you're really lazy, you can get to South Richmond Street by taking any of these buses from the city-centre: 14, 15, 16, 16A, 19, 19A, 83, 65B, 74.

If you're kinda lazy, you can catch the green-line Luas to "Charlemont", a five minute walk East along the canal.

Or if you're the healthy type, get a Dublin Bike from any bike station - there's a stop just across the road. Otherwise just walk it. It ain't that far!

Don't be the one in the corner going hungry, [sign up now](http://www.doodle.com/w9u6f23v6ugvubn3) to reserve your tapas plate! You can still come along if you haven't signed up... and if you're nice we might even give you some of the left overs...
