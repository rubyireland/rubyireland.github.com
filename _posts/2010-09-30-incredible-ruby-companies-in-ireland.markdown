So about a month ago we put out a call for companies using Ruby to get in touch. The response has been great with almost two dozen seizing the initiative. Thanks for getting in touch!

There's an interesting mix of firms in the melting pot -  online music and video services, software development houses, finance/business solution providers, consumer facing sites and more.
