November's meetup saw a great turn out to see two excellent talks by [Declan McGrath](http://www.twitter.com/theirishpenguin) & [Ana Nelson](http://www.twitter.com/ananelson) covering scraper wiki & dexy respectively with a some deep conversations after over a beer or two. Here's my round up of the evening:


## Scraper wiki - public web scrapers


Scraper wiki is a tool that allows anyone to create scrapers with all the coding done in the browser, from the [scraperwiki](http://www.scraperwiki.com) website here's a quick about scraperwiki:



	
  * Online code editor, write debug and run Python, PHP or Ruby in your browser

	
  * ScraperWiki code libraries make scraping, parsing and geocoding simple

	
  * Store data direct to the datastore

	
  * API access to data in XML, JSON, PHP, YAML or CSV

	
  * Schedule scrapers to re-run so your data is always up-to-date

	
  * Email alerts if your scrapers fail

	
  * Built in source control


Watch out for a more in depth post by Declan shortly as he delves more into scraperwiki.


## Dexy : Make - docs - sexy


Ana presented a talk in [dexy](http://www.dexy.it) a tool she's developed to make documentation of software projects a lot easier. Ana's developed dexy as open source project. The potential uses for dexy in automating the documentation process are endless. So make sure you check it out [here](http://www.dexy.it), there's also twitter channel [there](http://www.twitter.com/dexyit).

Tech mentions during the talks included :

[Watir](http://www.watir.com) -  A simple and flexible open-source tool for automating web browsers.

[XLRD](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd) - An excel library written in python


## Almost random site mention :


Ana mentioned [propublica](http://www.propublica.org) as an great of a site collaboration between developers and SME's (Subject Matter Experts) in this case journalists which further echoed Declan's point during his talk whereby subject matter experts who need better & more contextualised information need the help of developers to make it happen and tools such as scraperwiki help hugely to organise and collate information.
