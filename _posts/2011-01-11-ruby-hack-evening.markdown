Hi all, 

Due to no speakers this month, we thought an evening of hacking would be a good idea. So if you're a newbie or more experienced hacker bring your laptop and drop into the Trinity Capital Hotel from 7 onwards. It'll be a great opportunity to brush up on your hacking skills also get to know your fellow ruby hackers!

Hope to see you all there!
