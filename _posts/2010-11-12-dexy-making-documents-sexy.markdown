This month's talk by Ana Nelson will be on [dexy ](http://www.dexy.it/)an open source tool for writing maintainable software documentation in any language, or in any combination of languages. Dexy was developed by Ana to make the process of documentation in software projects easier & sexier, anything that help with documentation has to be a good thing! It's certainly something I'm looking forward to using in my projects:

_Dexy is a new tool for writing maintainable software documentation in
any language, or in any combination of languages. Dexy makes it easy
to combine live source code, irb transcripts, ri documentation and
screenshots to write tutorials, blog posts, code journals, research
reports, user guides, install docs, websites and anything else you
want, in pretty much any format you want._

_Documentation is what sells your software and what keeps your users
loyal and productive. With Dexy it's easy to write useful
documentation, to maintain it as your code changes, to iterate it
based on feedback, and to keep it up to date. Â Because everything's
automated, it's also easy to customize and personalize documentation
(imagine the screenshots in the documentation for your web application
personalized with each customer's own branding).
_

_No longer does the non-Ruby code in your project need to be a 2nd
class documentation citizen. And no longer will your documentation
tool determine what type of documentation you can write. With Dexy you
can simply concentrate on communication._
