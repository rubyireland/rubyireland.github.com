You might remember Brian Quinn from the March 2011 meet-up when he spoke about Spree Commerce, an open source e-commerce platform written in Rails. Since then Spree has become one of the most popular open source projects on GitHub. The Spree team is now hosting a developer’s conference in Dublin, August 22nd and 23rd.

The conference is designed to appeal to general programmers with talks on JavaScript, Backbone, Rails, and other e-commerce topics. This is also an opportunity to see some big name speakers including:



	
  * **Yehuda Katz ** - Ruby on Rails and jQuery core team member

	
  * **Gregg Pollack ** - From Ruby5 podcast and Code School

	
  * **Ryan Bigg ** - Author of “Rails 3 in Action”
