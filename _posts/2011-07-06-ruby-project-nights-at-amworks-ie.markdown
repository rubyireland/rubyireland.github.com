Last month the [Ruby Ireland](http://rubyireland.com) [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/ruby_ireland?hl=en) was [hit](https://groups.google.com/group/ruby_ireland/browse_thread/thread/9f92b7c95c2b7de5?hl=en) with great news: Alan from [amworks](http://www.amworks.ie/) invited everybody to join in a Ruby Project Night on the evening
of the 16th of June.

The rules were fairly simple:


> Come work on your Ruby on Rails projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out. Weâ€™ll have a multi-screen wireless projector for showcasing your project or problem solving.


And so we did... well, a bunch of us anyway!
While some people decided to work on their own projects, some others joined efforts to create a gem for rails 3, something that none of us had had the chance to do before. After a bit of discussion, we finally settled on the idea of creating a gem to provide that typical button that you see on the side of many blogs to send feedback to the blogger.

The session was very relaxed and there was a lot of chatting, teaching (thanks to [Declan](http://www.theirishpenguin.com/) for his introduction to Ruby Modules), and a bit of coding. The end result was a [gem skeleton](https://github.com/theirishpenguin/ruby_ireland_feedback) that properly installs when prompted.

Ruby Project Nights will continue this month and on the second Thursday of each month from now on (at least in the near future). Some more work on the feedback gem will be done but as usual, if you want to bring in your own project (even if it's not Ruby, we won't let Alan know!) feel free to do so.

It would be great to see a bunch of new faces, specially those of you who would like to give Ruby a try but haven't had a chance to do so. The floor will be open for questions, discussion, sharing, and learning.

**Summary:**
Ruby Project Night on [July 14th 6.30pm](http://www.amworks.ie/event/ruby-project-nights) [@amworks](http://twitter.com/#!/amworks) [map](http://www.amworks.ie/contactus)
All welcome whether you have a project or not, you are a rubyist or not, you have an interest in web development or not.

Many thanks to Alan for making this possible and if there are any questions please shout. Hope to see some of you guys there!
