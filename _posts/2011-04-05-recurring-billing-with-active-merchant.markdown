Matt Hutchinson presents his work on recurring billing with Active Merchant at this months Ruby Ireland meetup, which will be held at Twisted Pepper (54 Middle Abbey Street, Dublin 1). The event will go ahead on Tuesday, 12th of April at 7pm. 

This continues the e-commerce theme of last month, so now you've no excuse not to be a Ruby-based Internet millionaire! Active Merchant is an extraction from the e-commerce system [Shopify](http://shopify.com) and you can find out more at [ActiveMerchant.org](http://www.activemerchant.org)

If you could indicate your [attendance](http://www.doodle.com/c5kbmf7pync72gug) for this event then you are awesome. But we'll still love you even if you don't : -)
